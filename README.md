# Faster RCNN
My [Faster RCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497) implementation for [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/), using Tensorflow (Keras). Effort is made to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.

This is still a **Work in Progress**.

## Current Status

- &#9745; Base network
- &#9745; Anchors generation
- &#9745; RPN (Region Proposal Network)
- &#9744; NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)
- &#9744; Classifier
